    "Normal text is divided into sections and subsections using headings.\n",
    "The top-level heading (H1) is reserved for page titles (major section titles).\n",
    "Heading levels 2 and 3 are used for internal sections and sub-sections.\n",
    "Heading level 4 should be used for \"Check your understanding\" sub-sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text formatting conventions (commands/code in `monospace`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary term\n",
    "\n",
    "Important terms should be included in italics using the glossary.\n",
    "Glossary terms can be added with the format\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*{term}`Glossary term`*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where \"Glossary term\" is the item listed in the glossary at `back-matter/glossary.md`.\n",
    "It is also possible to have different text listed when linking to a glossary item, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*{term}`My glossary item <item>`*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the link to the glossary entry \"item\" has the displayed text \"My glossary item\".\n",
    "\n",
    "References\n",
    "\n",
    "URLs should use footnotes such as[^url1].\n",
    "Footnotes are formatted as `[^footnote]` when placed in the text.\n",
    "They are enclosed in square brackets and start with the `^` character.\n",
    "At the end of the document, the footnote definitions can be given in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[^footnote]: Footnote text and or URL with the form <https://jupyter.org>. Note the angled brackets `<` and `>` enclose the URL to autolink them.\n",

    "- Code blocks\n",
    "- Admonitions (let's not use more than 2-3, if possible)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This is a note. It expands on the main text or indicates additional information not included in the main text. Additional reference material or differences from past topics, for example.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
