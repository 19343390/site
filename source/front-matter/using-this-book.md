# How to use this book

Here we describe the typographical and formatting conventions used in this book.

## General text formatting

Normal text is divided into sections and subsections using headings.
The top-level heading is reserved for page titles.
Heading levels 2 and 3 are used for sections and sub-sections.
Heading level 4 should be used for "Check your understanding" sub-sections.

Text formatting conventions (commands/code in `monospace`, etc.)

Terms (with glossary links) in *italics*?

References

URLs use footnotes[^url1]

## Special text formatting blocks

- Code blocks
- Admonitions (let's not use more than 2-3, if possible)

```{note}
This is a hint. It expands on the main text or indicates additional information not included in the main text. Additional reference material or differences from past topics, for example.
```

```{tip}
This is a tip. Tips should be used for helpful reminders or suggested use cases.
```

```{warning}
This is a warning. This is text that warns of potential for problems if it is ignored. This could be used to indicate unexpected behavior, such as needing to create copies of dataframes to avoid modifying source dataframes.
```
