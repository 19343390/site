# Getting started with pandas

## What is pandas?

``pandas`` [^urlpandas] is a modern, powerful and feature rich library that is designed for doing
data analysis in Python. It is a mature data analytics framework that is widely used among different fields of science, thus there exists a lot of good examples and documentation that can help you get going with your data analysis tasks. The development of pandas started in 2008 and it is now maintained by an active developer community ({cite}`McKinney2017`).

pandas is a "high-level" package, which means that it makes use of several other packages in the background.
Pandas combines the performance of powerful Python libraries such as ``numpy`` [^urlnumpy],
``matplotlib`` [^urlmatplotlib] and ``scipy`` [^urlscipy]. Thus, you can use many of the features included in those packages even without importing them separately. This book focuses primarily on pandas because it is easy-to-use, efficient and intuitive.

One of the most useful features of pandas is its ability to write and read data to and from numerous data formats.
It supports reading and writing data e.g. from/to:

- CSV
- JSON
- HTML
- MS Excel
- HDF5
- Stata
- SAS
- Python Pickle format
- SQL (Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, etc.)

See full list from the latest pandas documentation [^urlpandasdocs].

## Pandas data structures

In pandas, table-like data are stored in two-dimensional DataFrames with labeled rows and columns. You can think of the pandas DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. The pandas DataFrame was originally inspired by dataframes that are in-built in the R programming language. One-dimensional sequences of values are stored in pandas Series. One row or one column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. You can think of a pandas Series as a clever list. These pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types.

*pandas DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure used for storing and mainpulating table-like data (data with rows and columns). pandas Series is a 1-dimensional data structure used for storing and manipulating an sequence of values.*



As you can see, both DataFrames and Series in pandas have an index that can be used to select values, but they also have column labels to identify columns in DataFrames. In the next sections, we will use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures.

For a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures, we recommend you to have a look at pandas online documentation about data structures [^urlds] as well as Chapter 5 in {cite}`McKinney2017`.

## Reading tabular data 

In the following sections, we will learn how to read data from a text file (*Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt*) which contains weather observations from Kumpula, Helsinki (Finland). The data was retrieved from NOAA [^urlnoaa1] climate database and it contains observed daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures from June 2016, recorded by a weather observation station in Kumpula. The file includes altogether 30 rows of observations (one per day). The first fifteen rows in the file look like following:

```
# Data file contents: Daily temperatures (mean, min, max) for Kumpula, Helsinki
#                     for June 1-30, 2016
# Data source: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND
# Data processing: Extracted temperatures from raw data file, converted to
#                  comma-separated format
#
# David Whipp - 02.10.2017

YEARMODA,TEMP,MAX,MIN
20160601,65.5,73.6,54.7
20160602,65.8,80.8,55.0
20160603,68.4,,55.6
20160604,57.5,70.9,47.3
20160605,51.4,58.3,43.2
20160606,52.2,59.7,42.8
```


Now as we have familiarized ourselves with the data, we can continue and see how to read the CSV with pandas. Let's start by importing the ``pandas`` module. It is customary to import pandas as `pd`:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true
import pandas as pd
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Next, we will read the input data file and store the contents of that file into a variable called `data` Using the `read_csv()` function:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/NOAA/daily/Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt')
```


Our input file is a comma-delimited file, meaning that the columns in the data are separted by commas (`,`) on each row. The `read_csv()` function uses comma as the default delimiter, hence we did not need to specify it separately in the command above. If all went as planned, you should now have a new variable `data` in memory that contains the input data. 

It is quite common to have some other character instead of comma separating the columns from each other. The `read_csv()` is a generic function for reading text-based data files, supporting files separated by commas, spaces, or other common separators. The `sep` parameter can be used to specify which character is used as a delimiter. For instance `sep=';'`, would assume that the columns in the data file are delimited with semicolon (`;`). For a full list of available parameters, please refer to the pandas documentation for pandas.read_csv [^urlreadcsv], or run `help(pd.read_csv)`. Pandas has also several functions for parsing input data from different formats. For example, reading Excel files can be easily done by using a function `read_excel()`. Another useful function is `read_pickle()` that reads data stored in the Python pickle format. Check out the pandas documentation about input and output functions [^urlpandasiotools] for more details about reading data.



Let's check the the contents of this variable by calling `data` or `print(data)`:

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print(data)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
This looks OK, but there are some strange values present such as `NaN`, and the first lines of the dataframe look a bit weird.

`NaN` stands for "not a number", and might indicate some problem with reading in the contents of the file. Plus, we expected about 30 lines of data, but the index values go up to 36 when we print the contents of the `data` variable. Looks like we need to investigate this further.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
As we can observe, there are some metadata at the top of the file giving basic information about its contents and source. This isn't data we want to process, so we need to skip over that part of the file when we load it.

Here are the 8 first rows of data in the text file (note that the 8th row is blank):
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
```
# Data file contents: Daily temperatures (mean, min, max) for Kumpula, Helsinki
#                     for June 1-30, 2016
# Data source: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND
# Data processing: Extracted temperatures from raw data file, converted to
#                  comma-separated format
#
# David Whipp - 02.10.2017

```
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Fortunately, skipping over rows is easy to do when reading in data using pandas. We just need to add the `skiprows` parameter when we read the file, listing the number of rows to skip (8 in this case).

Let's try reading the datafile again, and this time defining the `skiprows` parameter.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/NOAA/daily/Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt', skiprows=8)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Let's now print the dataframe and see what changed:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print(data)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
After reading in the data, it is always good to check that everything went well by printing out the data as we did here. However, often it is enough to have a look at the top few rows of the data. 

We can use the `head()` function of the pandas DataFrame object to quickly check the top rows. By default, the `head()` function returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data.head()
```

We can also check the last rows of the data using `data.tail()`:

```python
data.tail()
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Note that pandas DataFrames have **labelled axes (rows and columns)**.  In our sample data, the rows labeled with an index value (`0` to `29`), and columns labelled `YEARMODA`, `TEMP`, `MAX`, and `MIN`. Later on, we will learn how to use these labels for selecting and updating subsets of the data.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Let's also confirm the data type of our data variable:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
type(data)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
No surprises here, our data variable is a pandas DataFrame.
<!-- #endregion -->

It is also possible to read only specific columns from the data when using the `read_csv` function. You can achieve this using the `usecols` parameter when reading the file which accepts a list of column names that will be included in the resulting DataFrame. Also positional indices (e.g. `[0, 1]`) corresponding the position of the column in the file can be used to specify which columns should be read. For additional details, see the pandas documention [^readcsv].

Next, we will read the file `Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt` again and store its contents into a new variable called `temp_data`. In this case, we will only read the columns `YEARMODA` and `TEMP`, meaning that the new variable `temp_data` should have 30 rows and 2 columns. 

```python
temp_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/NOAA/daily/Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt', 
                        skiprows=8, usecols=["YEARMODA", "TEMP"])
```

```python
temp_data.head()
```

As a result, we now have only two columns instead of the original four. Using the `usecols` function to limit the number of columns can be useful when having datafiles with possibly tens or even hundreds of columns. Typically you are not interested in all of them, but you want focus on only a few important ones which you can select already when reading the data.  

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
## Basic data exploration
### DataFrame properties

Let's continue with the full data set that we have stored in the variable `data` and explore it's contents further. 
A normal first step when you load new data is to explore the dataset a bit to understand how the data is structured, and what kind of values are stored in there.
<!-- #endregion -->

Let's start by checking the size of our data frame. We can use the `len()` function similar to the use with lists to check how many rows we have:

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Check the number of rows 
len(data)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
We can also get a quick sense of the size of the dataset using the `shape` attribute.

<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Check dataframe shape (number of rows, number of columns)
data.shape
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Here we see that our dataset has 30 rows and 4 columns, just as we saw above when printing out the entire DataFrame. Pay attention that we do not use parentheses after the word `shape` when accessing attributes. The `shape` in here is one of the several ``attributes`` related to a pandas DataFrame object. Attributes are typically used to store useful information (or *metadata*) about the object at hand. We will see many more examples of these throughout the book. 

<!-- #endregion -->

Let's also check the column names we have in our DataFrame (yes, it is an attribute as well!). We already saw the column names when we checked the 5 first rows using `data.head()`, but often it is useful to access the column names directly. You can check the column names by calling `data.columns` (returns an index object that contains the column labels) or `data.columns.values`:

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Print column names
data.columns.values
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
We can also find information about the row identifiers using the `index` attribute:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Print index
data.index
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Here we see how the data is indexed, starting at 0, ending at 30, and with an increment of 1 between each value. This is basically the same way in which Python lists are indexed, however, pandas allows also other ways of identifying the rows. DataFrame indices could, for example, be character strings, or date objects. We will learn more about resetting the index later.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
What about the data types of each column in our dataFrame? We can check the data type of all columns at once using `pandas.DataFrame.dtypes`:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Print data types
data.dtypes
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Here we see that `YEARMODA` is an integer value (with 64-bit precision; ``int64``), while the other values are all decimal values with 64-bit precision (float64).
<!-- #endregion -->

**Check your understanding**

See if you can find a way to print out the number of columns in our DataFrame.


### Selecting columns


When conducting data analysis, it is very common that you want to choose certain columns from the data for further processing. We can select specific columns based on the column values. The basic syntax is `dataframe[value]`, where value can be a single column name, or a list of column names. Let's start by selecting two columns, `'YEARMODA'` and `'TEMP'`:

```python
selection = data[['YEARMODA','TEMP']]
```

```python
selection
```

Let's also check the data type of this selection:

```python
type(selection)
```

The subset is still a pandas DataFrame, and we are able to use all the methods and attributes related to a pandas DataFrame also with this subset. For example, we can check the shape:

```python
selection.shape
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
We can also access a single column of the data based on the column name:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data['TEMP']
```

What about the type of the column itself?

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Check datatype of the column
type(data['TEMP'])
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Each column (and each row) in a pandas data frame is indeed a pandas Series.
<!-- #endregion -->

````{note}
You can also retreive a column using a different syntax:
    
``` 
data.TEMP
```

This syntax works only if the column name is a valid name for a Python variable (e.g. the column name should not contain whitespace). The syntax `data["column"]` works for all kinds of column names, so we recommend using this approach.
````

<!-- #region editable=true -->
### Unique values
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region editable=true -->
Sometimes it is useful to extract the unique values that you have in your column.
We can do that by using `unique()` method:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Get unique celsius values
data['TEMP'].unique()
```

<!-- #region editable=true -->
As a result we get an array of unique values in that column. We can also directly access the number of unique values using the `nunique()` method:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Number of unique values
print("There were", data['TEMP'].nunique(), "days with unique mean temperatures in June 2016.")
```

### Descriptive statistics

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Pandas DataFrames and Series contain useful methods for getting summary statistics. Available methods include `mean()`, `median()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `std()` (the standard deviation).
<!-- #endregion -->

We could, for example, check the mean temperature in our input data. We check the mean for a single column (*Series*): 

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Check mean value of a column
data['TEMP'].mean()
```

and for all columns (in the *DataFrame*):

```python
# Check mean value for all columns
data.mean()
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
For an overview of the basic statistics for all attributes in the data, we can use the `describe()` method:

<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Get descriptive statistics
data.describe()
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
## Different ways of constructing pandas objects

Most often we create pandas objects by reading in data from an external source, such as a text file. Here, we will briefly show different ways how you can create pandas objects from Python objects (lists and dictionaries). 

If you have a very long lists of numbers, creating a pandas Series (or numpy.array) will allow you to interact with these values more efficiently in terms of computing time that using and working with a pure Python list.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python deletable=true editable=true jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# Create pandas Series from a list
number_series = pd.Series([ 4, 5, 6, 7.0])
print(number_series)
```

<!-- #region deletable=true editable=true -->
Note that Pandas is smart about the conversion, detecting a single floating point value (`7.0`) and assigning all values in the Series the data type float64.
<!-- #endregion -->

If needed, you can also set a custom index when creating the object:

```python
number_series = pd.Series([ 4, 5, 6, 7.0], index=['a','b','c','d'])
print(number_series)
```

```python
type(number_series)
```

How about combining several lists and construct a DataFrame from them? Certainly. Let's see how we can convert lists into a pandas DataFrame. Let's first create a few lists having the same number of items each.

```python
# Station names
stations = ['Hanko Russarö', 'Heinola Asemantaus', 'Helsinki Kaisaniemi', 'Helsinki Malmi airfield']

# Latitude coordinates of Weather stations  
lats = [59.77, 61.2, 60.18, 60.25]

# Longitude coordinates of Weather stations 
lons = [22.95, 26.05, 24.94, 25.05]
```

Now we can create a pandas DataFrames by using the `pandas.DataFrame` constructor and passing a *Python dictionary* `{"column_1": list_1, "column_2": list_2, ...}` to it, indicating the structure of our data. 

```python
# Create DataFrame from a dictionary of lists
new_data = pd.DataFrame(data = {"station_name" : stations, "lat" : lats, "lon" : lons})
new_data
```

It is also possible to create pandas DataFrame from a list of dictionaries. Hence, this approach is quite similar as the previous example, but we organize the data a bit differently. Having a list of dictionaries is common if you happen to work with ``JSON`` files, which are commonly used when reading data from the web (e.g. via ``Application Programming Interface``). 

```python
# Create a list of dictionaries
dictionaries = [{'station_name': 'Hanko Russarö', 'lat': 59.77, 'lon': 22.95},
                {'station_name': 'Heinola Asemantaus', 'lat': 61.2, 'lon': 26.05},
                {'station_name': 'Helsinki Kaisaniemi', 'lat': 60.18, 'lon': 24.94},
                {'station_name': 'Helsinki Malmi airfield', 'lat': 60.25, 'lon': 25.05}]

# Pass the list into the DataFrame constructor
new_data_2 = pd.DataFrame(dictionaries)
new_data_2
```

As a result, we got an identical DataFrame as in our first example above. Notice, that sometimes you might start working with an empty DataFrame and only later "populate" it with new columns:

```python
# Create an empty DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame()
print(df)
```

Now we have an empty DataFrame, and we can add new columns to it based on the lists we created earlier. Notice that this approach requires that the length of all the lists that you want to add are equal:  

```python
# Add columns to the empty DataFrame 
# based on lists that have same number of items
df["lon"] = lons
df["lat"] = lats

df
```
