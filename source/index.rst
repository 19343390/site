Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis
===================================================

In this book, we introduce the basics of Python programming and geographic data analysis for all "geo-minded" people (geographers, geologists and others using spatial data). We introduce topics assuming readers may not have any past programming experience.

Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis will be available openly online at `pythongis.net <https://pythongis.net>`_. Physical copies of the book will be available later from CRC press.
